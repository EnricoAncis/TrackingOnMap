# TrackingOnMap
Demo app to track users on Google Maps.

It can:
- display the user’s current location on a map;
- Update the map in real time as the user moves;
- In response to a “tracking on/off” UI switch, record or do not record the user’s movements;
- Display a path over the map as the user moves, that represents the user’s movements that are currently being recorded;
- If a journey is defined as a set of recorded locations between a tracking on and a tracking off switch, retain the user’s journeys.

Coming soon:
Background service to record the user’s location in the if the user selects “tracking on” and closes the UI.
